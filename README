This is MiniTK, an easy to use set of OpenGL and OpenAL bindings for C#, based on OpenTK. It is designed for use with (and was originally part of) SDL2#, a C# wrapper for SDL2, but does not depend on that project. See https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS for more information.

Using MiniTK
------------
To use the OpenGL/OpenAL bindings, simply use them as you were with OpenTK,
but after calling SDL_GL_CreateContext, add the following lines:

OpenTK.Graphics.GraphicsContext.CurrentContext = yourContextIntPtr;
GL.LoadAll( SDL.SDL_GL_GetProcAddress );

This will load the OpenTK entry points.
